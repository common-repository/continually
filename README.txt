== Description ==

Research shows that businesses who respond faster close more sales. Today, when buyers get in touch through your website — say to request a product demo, they expect you to reply quickly, even out of hours or when they’re in a different time zone.

But most websites make customers fill out forms that ask for too much information, then when you fill them in — don’t do anything useful with it.

With Continually, you can use automated messages to respond to visitors in a way that’s personalised, low effort and most importantly — instant.
